### Master Orchestrator Lambda for DB Admin User Reporting

#### Overview
- Purpose: Coordinate execution of DB admin access reporting across multiple AWS accounts and regions.
- Outcome: Centralized system for compliance teams to generate audit reports quickly and reduce manual effort.

---

### Requirements & Features

#### 1. General
- Language & Runtime:
  - TypeScript
  - Node.js runtime

#### 2. Input & Configuration
- Accepts config parameters for target AWS accounts and regions.
- Reads DB inventory/configuration from S3 (central configuration store).
  
#### 3. Cross-Account Invocation
- Uses cross-account IAM roles to invoke worker Lambdas in target accounts.
  
#### 4. Worker Lambda Execution Management
- Implements a 10-minute timeout for each worker Lambda invocation.
- Adds exponential backoff retry logic with a max of 3 retries for handling failures.
  
#### 5. Result Handling
- Collects reports from all worker Lambdas.
- Validates worker Lambda responses before processing.
- Aggregates collected data into consolidated CSV reports.
- Adds timestamp metadata to reports.
  
#### 6. Storage
- Stores consolidated reports in a central S3 bucket.
- Uses an organized naming convention for reports (e.g., by date, account, region).

#### 7. Logging & Monitoring
- Logs all operations to CloudWatch.
- Uses appropriate log levels: INFO, WARN, ERROR.
  
#### 8. Partial Failure Handling
- Handles partial failures gracefully.
- Reports status of each account separately.
- Comprehensive error handling for:
  - Network timeouts
  - Permission issues

#### 9. Performance & Scalability
- Optimized for handling 10+ databases across multiple accounts efficiently.

### High-Level Workflow

1. **Initialization**
   - Parse config parameters (accounts, regions).
   - Load DB inventory from S3 config store.

2. **Invocation Loop**
   - For each account and region:
     - Assume IAM role using STS for cross-account access.
     - Invoke worker Lambda asynchronously with a 10-minute timeout.
     - Handle worker failures with exponential backoff retry (up to 3 retries).

3. **Results Aggregation**
   - Collect worker Lambda responses.
   - Validate and process each response.
   - Aggregate data into a consolidated CSV report.
   - Add timestamp and metadata.

4. **Storage & Reporting**
   - Upload final CSV report to central S3 bucket.
   - Follow structured naming for easy retrieval.

5. **Logging & Error Handling**
   - Log each stepâ€™s success/failure details.
   - Aggregate partial failure info and report adequately.
