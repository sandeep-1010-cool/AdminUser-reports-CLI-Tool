# Add comprehensive CloudWatch logging and monitoring

## üìã Description

Implement detailed logging throughout the Lambda function to support troubleshooting and monitoring of the reporting process.

## üìù Tasks

- **Add structured logging with JSON format for all major operations**
- **Log start/end times, account processing status, and error details**
- **Include correlation IDs to trace requests across worker Lambda calls**
- **Set appropriate log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) for different events**
- **Add custom CloudWatch metrics for success/failure rates per account**
- **Ensure no sensitive data (passwords, connection strings) appears in logs**

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

This task is complete when all major operations are logged with appropriate detail levels and custom metrics appear in CloudWatch. Logs provide enough information to troubleshoot failures without exposing sensitive data.

## üìù Notes

- **CloudWatch logs charges are based on data ingested - avoid logging large payloads**
- **Log retention should be set appropriately for compliance requirements**
- **Structured JSON logs are easier to query with CloudWatch Insights**
- **Consider log sampling for high-frequency debug messages**
- **Test log output in AWS environment as local logging behaves differently**
- **Correlation IDs help trace distributed calls across multiple Lambda functions**
