# Set up basic Lambda function structure and environment configuration

## 📋 Description

Create the initial TypeScript Lambda function with proper project structure, dependencies, and environment variable configuration for the master orchestrator.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Initialize TypeScript project with proper tsconfig and package.json**
- **Set up AWS Lambda handler with basic request/response structure**
- **Configure environment variables for account list, regions, S3 bucket names**
- **Add TypeScript types for configuration parameters and Lambda events**
- **Set up local development environment with AWS SAM or similar**
- **Create basic unit test structure with Jest**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when the Lambda function can be built, deployed locally, and invoked with test data returning a basic response. All environment variables are properly configured and validated at startup.

## 📝 Notes

- **AWS SAM CLI setup can take longer than expected if not familiar with it**
- **TypeScript compilation issues often surface late in development**
- **Environment variable validation should happen early to catch config issues**
- **Consider using AWS CDK or Pulumi for eventual deployment but start simple**
