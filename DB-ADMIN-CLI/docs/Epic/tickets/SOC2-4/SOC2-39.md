# Add timeout handling and exponential backoff retry logic

## 📋 Description

Implement robust timeout handling and retry mechanisms for worker Lambda invocations to handle failures gracefully.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Set up 10-minute timeout for individual worker Lambda executions**
- **Implement exponential backoff retry logic with max 3 attempts**
- **Handle different types of failures (network, permission, Lambda errors)**
- **Add jitter to retry delays to avoid thundering herd problems**
- **Track retry attempts and final success/failure status per account**
- **Log retry attempts and reasons for troubleshooting**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when the retry logic successfully handles worker Lambda failures with exponential backoff and proper timeout handling. The system retries failed invocations up to 3 times and logs all retry attempts clearly.

## 📝 Notes

- **Lambda maximum execution time is 15 minutes - plan accordingly**
- **Exponential backoff can quickly reach very long delays - cap the maximum**
- **Network issues often resolve quickly, but permission issues need manual fixes**
- **Consider circuit breaker pattern if same accounts consistently fail**
- **Retry logic testing requires mocking or deliberately failing test services**
- **Be careful not to exceed Lambda memory limits when tracking many retry states**
