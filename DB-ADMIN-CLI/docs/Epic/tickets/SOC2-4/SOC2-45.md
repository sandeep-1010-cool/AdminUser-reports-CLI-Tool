# End-to-end testing with realistic data and multiple AWS accounts

## 📋 Description

Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the master orchestrator Lambda with realistic database inventories across multiple AWS accounts to validate the complete workflow.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Set up test database inventory configuration with realistic account and database data**
- **Test complete workflow from CLI trigger through CSV report generation**
- **Validate cross-account permissions and worker Lambda coordination**
- **Test failure scenarios including partial account failures and network timeouts**
- **Verify CSV report format and content with sample data from multiple accounts**
- **Test both manual CLI execution and direct Lambda invocation**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when end-to-end testing passes with realistic multi-account data and all report outputs are validated. Both success and failure scenarios are tested and documented.

## 📝 Notes

- **End-to-end testing requires coordination with teams managing target AWS accounts**
- **Test data should mirror production complexity without using real sensitive data**
- **Network timeouts and permission issues are common in cross-account testing**
- **Consider using dedicated test accounts to avoid impacting production systems**
- **Document all test scenarios and results for future regression testing**
- **Testing cross-account functionality can take longer due to AWS propagation delays**
