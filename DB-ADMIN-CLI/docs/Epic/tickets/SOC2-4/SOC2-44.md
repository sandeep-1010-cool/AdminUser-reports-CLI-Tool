# Add comprehensive error handling and response validation

## 📋 Description

Implement robust error handling for all failure scenarios and validate worker Lambda responses before processing.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Add try-catch blocks around all major operations with specific error handling**
- **Validate worker Lambda response format and required fields**
- **Handle network timeouts, permission errors, and service unavailability**
- **Create meaningful error messages for different failure types**
- **Implement graceful degradation when some accounts fail**
- **Add input validation for configuration parameters and environment variables**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when the function handles all common error scenarios gracefully and validates all inputs and responses properly. Error messages provide actionable information for troubleshooting.

## 📝 Notes

- **AWS service errors often have specific error codes that need different handling**
- **Validation schemas should be defined early and shared with worker Lambda team**
- **Consider using libraries like Joi or Zod for robust input validation**
- **Error handling should not mask real issues - log detailed errors internally**
- **Partial success scenarios are common in distributed systems**
- **Network errors often retry successfully but permission errors need manual fixes**
