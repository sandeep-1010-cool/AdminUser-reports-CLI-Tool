# Implement S3 configuration reading for database inventory

## 📋 Description

Build the function to read database inventory configuration from S3 and parse it into usable data structures for the master orchestrator.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Create S3 client with proper IAM permissions for cross-account access**
- **Implement function to read JSON/YAML config file from S3 bucket**
- **Parse database inventory into TypeScript interfaces**
- **Add validation for required fields (account, region, database type, connection info)**
- **Handle S3 access errors and missing files gracefully**
- **Write unit tests for config parsing and validation**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when the function successfully reads the database inventory from S3 and returns a validated, parsed configuration object. Error handling works correctly for missing files and malformed data.

## 📝 Notes

- **S3 cross-account permissions can be tricky - test early with actual accounts**
- **Large config files might need streaming instead of loading into memory**
- **Consider caching config in memory for duration of Lambda execution**
- **Config file format should be agreed upon with team before coding starts**
- **S3 eventual consistency could cause issues with recently updated configs**
