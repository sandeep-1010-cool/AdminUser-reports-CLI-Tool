# Implement S3 report storage with organized naming convention

## 📋 Description

Store the generated CSV reports in the central S3 bucket with a consistent naming convention and proper metadata.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Upload CSV reports to S3 with organized folder structure**
- **Implement naming convention: /reports/YYYY/MM/DD/timestamp-report-type.csv**
- **Add S3 object metadata for report type, generation time, account count**
- **Set proper S3 storage class and lifecycle policies**
- **Handle S3 upload failures and implement retry logic**
- **Add server-side encryption for sensitive report data**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when CSV reports are successfully uploaded to S3 with consistent naming and can be retrieved by date and report type. S3 metadata is properly set and reports are encrypted at rest.

## 📝 Notes

- **S3 eventual consistency might affect immediate retrieval of just-uploaded files**
- **Large reports might need multipart upload for reliability**
- **S3 bucket policies must allow cross-account write access from Lambda role**
- **Consider S3 versioning in case reports need to be regenerated**
- **Monitor S3 costs as report volume grows over time**
- **Test upload permissions thoroughly in target AWS accounts**
