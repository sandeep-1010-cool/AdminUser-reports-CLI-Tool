# Implement cross-account worker Lambda invocation with IAM roles

## 📋 Description

Build the core functionality to invoke worker Lambda functions in different AWS accounts using cross-account IAM role assumptions.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Implement STS assume role functionality for cross-account access**
- **Create Lambda invoke client with assumed role credentials**
- **Build function to invoke worker Lambdas with payload containing database list**
- **Handle different AWS regions and account combinations**
- **Add proper error handling for assume role failures**
- **Test with at least 2 different target accounts**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when the function successfully assumes roles in target accounts and invokes worker Lambdas with proper payloads. Cross-account invocation works for at least 2 test accounts across different regions.

## 📝 Notes

- **Cross-account role assumption can take 15-30 seconds to propagate after creation**
- **IAM role trust relationships must be set up by infrastructure team first**
- **Lambda invocation limits (1000 concurrent) could be hit with many accounts**
- **Network timeouts are common with cross-account calls - plan for retries**
- **Different regions may have different service availability**
- **Consider using AWS SDK v3 for better performance and smaller bundle size**
