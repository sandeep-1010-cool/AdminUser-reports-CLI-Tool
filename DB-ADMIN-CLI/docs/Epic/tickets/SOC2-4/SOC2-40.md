# Build result collection and data aggregation system

## 📋 Description

Collect responses from all worker Lambdas and aggregate the database admin data into a single consolidated dataset.

## 📝 Tasks

- **Wait for all worker Lambda invocations to complete or timeout**
- **Collect successful responses and parse JSON data from each account**
- **Merge data from multiple accounts into unified structure**
- **Handle partial failures where some accounts succeed and others fail**
- **Sort and organize data by account, region, and database type**
- **Validate data format consistency across all worker responses**

## ✅ Definition of Done

This task is complete when the function successfully collects and merges responses from multiple worker Lambdas into a single dataset. The system handles partial failures gracefully and provides a clear status of which accounts succeeded or failed.

## 📝 Notes

- **Concurrent Lambda executions may complete in different orders**
- **Memory usage can grow quickly when aggregating data from many sources**
- **Consider streaming large datasets to avoid Lambda memory limits**
- **Worker response format must be standardized before this can be tested**
- **Timeouts for waiting on all workers should be less than total Lambda timeout**
